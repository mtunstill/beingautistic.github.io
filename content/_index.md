## Introduction

Hello. You have reached a website that really is ambitious but slow to take off. Just look at when this domain name (*beingautistic.co.uk*) was first registered. I'll cut the long story of multiple attempts to launch this website/blog. I have personally wanted to log my thoughts to the world without any agenda or filter.

Here's what will likely happen...

| *1) Some sort of real-time thought<br>dump of current affairs* | <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/WsNbxuFkLi3IuGI9NU" width="300" style="" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/theoffice-nbc-the-office-tv-WsNbxuFkLi3IuGI9NU"></a></p>

I don't want a structured blog anymore. But somewhere to write down 500 word*ish* pieces that indicate where my head is at on a topic.

| *2) A place to challenge autism, neurodiveristy<br> and whatever else in society.* | <img src="assets/images/person-covered-in-autism-puzzle-grok2ai.jpeg" width="250"> |
